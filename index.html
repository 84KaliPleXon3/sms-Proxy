  <h1>Bob &amp; Alice<br />Need To Talk</h1>
  <p  class="lead">But how can you make that happen easily, with a message system they're already familiar with, and have it work on pretty much any phone, but protect both of their numbers?</p>

    <h4>SMS Proxying</h4>
    <p>What happens when two of your users want to easily message each other, 
    but they don't want to give out their phone numbers.</p>
    <p>Maybe it's an ecommerce platform, and a buyer has a question for a 
    seller. Perhaps it's a freelance site, and a client wants to message a 
    potential contractor.</p>
    <p>Whatever the case, it's easy to mask a user's private number using a 
    Nexmo virtual number.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="span6">
    <h4>Example Code</h4>
    <p>This simple example allows users to SMS their email address to start an 
    SMS chat with another random user. A simple admin shows the proxied 
    connection and the chat logs.</p>
    <p>Both users SMS the same Nexmo virtual number, while their personal 
    numbers are masked by the proxy.</p>
